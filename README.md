# Basic CNN for Deepfake Image Classification

As DeepFake based on deep learning is currently becoming mature, it is more difficult for humans to distinguish whether the person speaking in the picture is synthetic. For modern people who are highly dependent on online social media, this will confuse the audience's perception and endanger social security.

This project refer to [MesoNet: a Compact Facial Video Forgery Detection Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00888) use Basic CNN to solve whether the imag was counterfeited.
